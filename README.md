Welcome to the first public release (V0.1)  of KSP Mod Mover!!!

This app changes your KSP with mods you have installed, or to launch it stock.You may be thinking “how is this different from CKAN?” Well, this does NOT delete or uninstall your mods, rather it just moves them to a different folder (until you click the “Add mods back” button), so when you launch your game, it doesn’t run with them causing KSP to launch way faster, and disabling/reenabling the mods only takes SECONDS!

Any problems: DM me on Twitter @KSPModMover and describe your problem
